# Rocky-Bot
RockyBot is a smart news analysis tool that allows users to input URLs of news articles and ask questions about them. It uses LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS to extract, chunk, embed, and retrieve information from real-time news sources. Built using Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for interacting with news content using natural language.
